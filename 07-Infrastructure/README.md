**Docker Compose**

Because the fictional Bank System includes more than one service, each one with a different DataBase this repo uses a Docker Compose file to start all the containers at the same time. The current version of the docker compose file includes not only the MongoDB container but the PostgreSQL container.

**To run the docker compose use the following commmand**

``` powershell
docker-compose up
```
